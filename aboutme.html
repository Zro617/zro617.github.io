          <h2>Starting from Scratch</h2>
          <p>
            My emergence started in 2012 on <a href="//scratch.mit.edu/users/Zro716">Scratch</a>. I joined because I wanted to express myself through programming. I'll admit, sadly I was a memelord, and my first few projects were based on that. But over
            time, I caught myself getting inspired to create useful projects - calculators, simulators, generators, thingamabobers... This became my true passion on Scratch. Of course I would still regress to the memelord within from time to time...
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2013, I was semi-permabanned from Scratch for reasons I will not disclose publicly. Months later I rejoined \"anew\" as <a href="//scratch.mit.edu/users/ProdigyZeta7/">ProdigyZeta7</a>, hoping I could return to my passion while cutting
            ties to my former alias. I needed a long time to get away from my past, to let things heal up while I continued my work.
          </p>
          <p>
            A year and a half later, and more recognition than ever before, I started to question myself. Was it right to shy away? It didn't feel right to be someone different all this time. I already redeemed myself in the community; returning to my past identity
            was a risk I was willing to take. After a monthlong campaign with the Scratch Team's front desk, I won my account back.
          </p>
          <p>
            Initially, I promised to use my account just for removing profane comments that piled up and close the story ASAP. Instead, I wanted to set things right. Too long I lied to everyone, saying that Zro716 was't me - I must've convinced so many people that
            they refused to believe the opposite. Eventually, I proved to everyone of the truth and we all lived happily ever after blah blah blah.
          </p>
          <p>
            Okay, some people might still be doubtful. But enough of that, I'm finished with that chapter, and I have moved on to continue making amazing projects on Scratch.
          </p>
          <p>
            Time slipped by and I found myself losing the motivation to work. As I realized how limited Scratch was for my ambitions, I turned my attention to other activities. I was a frequent forum junkie, doing what I can to help when I didn't feel like working
            on projects. I spend most of my time on <a href="//scratch.mit.edu/discuss/1/">Suggestions</a>, providing feedback for ideas and trying to counter shrewd arguments. I wrote many, many long posts to prove my point as well as inspire
            others to value post quality over post quantity. Nowadays, having accumulated more than four thousand combined posts on my accounts, I seldom post anymore. In the latter days of my forum expidenture, I tried participating in <a href="//scratch.mit.edu/users/discuss/31/">Advanced Topics</a>.
            I did win a few small 'challenges', but most of the time I was in over my head.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let me make this clear: I'm <i>not</i> through with Scratch yet. When I get enough free time and motivation, Scratch will be in its hayday...
          </p>
          <p>
            I joined a collaboration of Scratchers back in May 2015. I was reluctant at first, clinging to my lone-wolf programming style, but I convinced myself to join if it meant making some dream projects of mine come true. We were especially adamant about a
            lot of decisions, like what the collab name should be, what projects we should make; we eventually came to be known as <a href="//scratch.mit.edu/users/Sum8s/">Sum8s</a> (it was my idea) and unfortunately, we didn't make much progress
            from there. But behind the scenes, we were abuzz with discussion and brainstorming. Being in the collab was probably the best decision I ever made, despite the lack of work ethic, because I made some truly awesome friends.

          <h2>Becoming a Song Writer</h2>
          <p>
            Little did I care about making music in the past. In middle school, I played the trumpet in band, tried out the school piano, and dawdled in this thing called Music Ace Maestro and the better-known Garageband. Truth is, I sucked at playing music. I quit
            band when I was getting too many complaints about playing extra loud, and frankly I neglected to lube my trumpet's valves. I tried out composing music with MAM and Garageband, but my imagination was dry. What I was good at was identifying
            the
            <i>feeling</i> of a song when played.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Scratcher collab I joined in 2015 rejuvenated my long lost love of music. One day I was introduced to this free software called <a href="//lmms.io">LMMS</a>. I didn't get much use out of it at first, because a music studio was quite foreign
            to me. Experimentation was my specialty, and shortly after I produced <a href="https://soundcloud.com/zro-from-scratch/prodigy-z-ascension">my first song</a>. I know, it's pretty bare and not all that impressive. But it was the first time
            in a long time that I could express myself musically. Ever since, I've been getting much better at songwriting, especially chord progression and capturing those "feelings" I got when listening to esteemed song artists.
          </p>
          Most of my new songs were made using a web-based chiptune editor called <a href="//beepbox.co">Beepbox</a>. I fell in love with this thing pretty fast. My collab friends and I enjoy sharing our sketches with each other, some of them we've published
          on SoundCloud. Occassionally, in the late of night I'll be enraptured by the urge to make a song that is buzzing in my head so clearly, without any apparent source, so Beepbox becomes my prime medium for expressing those ideas.

          <h2>Hardcore Programmer</h2>
          <p>
            Everyday, I'm writing code. It could be for working with Scratch's API, or a secret program, or some other third thing. Nearly all of my programming is as a hobby, but it is my passion nonetheless.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am majoring in Computer Science so one would expect me to learn a multitude of languages. As of now, I've formally learned Java, Ruby, C++, and Visual Basic; I'm fluent in JavaScript, but I have no formal education for it; and I'm somewhat able to program
            in Batch and a couple esoteric languages. I've still got a long ways to go, so don't consider my current list as everything.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm often asked: \"What's your programming language of choice?\" It's tough for me to decide because I like the simplicity of Scratch, the functionality of Java and C++, and the flexibility of Ruby and JavaScript. It's a trilemma that wholeheartedly depends
            on what you want to do. Personally, I'd just say go for all of them: it's better to be prepared for anything than stick with the limitations of one.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most of my non-Scratch programming is in JavaScript, and you can find my work on <a href="//github.com/Zro617/">GitHub</a>. I work in short bursts, and often I have to fix syntactical errors more than adding to the code. But one thing is clear
            to me: I don't like to import libraries - I prefer to write all the code by myself, from blank document to deployment.
          </p>
          <p>
            One thing I strive to achieve in my later life is a remake of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defender_%282002_video_game%29">Defender</a>, one of my most loved childhood games. I'd love to start a collaboration with someone on it someday.
